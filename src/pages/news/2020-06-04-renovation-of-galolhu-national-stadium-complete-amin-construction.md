Galolhu National Stadium was handed over to Ministry of Youth and Sports yesterday after completion of the renovation project, contractor AMIN Construction has said.

Galolhu National Stadium, with a capacity of 13,000 people, is one of the venues for the 2014 Asian Federation Confederation (AFC) Challenge Cup to be held in Maldives from 19 to 30 May.

Operations Manager at AMIN Construction Mohamed Shujau said the company has delivered beyond the specifications that were required for the renovation of the stadium. Renovation of the second venue, Hithadhoo Zone Stadium in Addu City, is nearly complete, Shujau said.

AMIN Construction was commissioned for the MVR 71.5 million project to upgrade both venues on 12 February this year.

Minister of Youth and Sports Mohamed Maleeh Jamal said today that the Ministry will hold a special inauguration of the Galolhu National Stadium on Thursday night. A special football match is also planned for the coming weekend officially open Hithadhoo Zone Stadium, he said.

Changes to Hithadhoo Zone Stadium include; widening of staircases, construction of preparation rooms and the overhaul of the stadium’s lighting systems. Assembly of the lighting system will be completed within the next two days, Sports Ministry said.

Special areas for referees and the match commissioner, along with a press room and press box have been constructed in Galolhu National Stadium.

Matches by the Maldives national team will be played in the Galolhu National Stadium in the capital Male’. Group B matches are to take place in Hithadhoo Zone Stadium in Addu City.
